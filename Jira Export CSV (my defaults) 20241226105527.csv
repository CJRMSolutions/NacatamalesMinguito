Currently, the signup data is sent to the endpoint {{/patient/SignUpWithEmailAndPhoneNumber/{0}/{1}?phoneNumber={2}}}. We need to implement the logic for generating and transmitting a unique customer ID as part of this signup process.

*Description:*
In the job transfer history grid, enhance the display to include TransferReason and TransferMode columns. These columns will provide users with additional information about each job transfer, showing the reason for the transfer and the mode through which it was conducted. Positioning these columns directly after the Is Success column ensures clarity and logical flow in the display of job transfer details.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# *Grid Layout:*
#* Modify the job transfer history grid to include TransferReason and TransferMode columns.
#* Ensure TransferReason and TransferMode columns are positioned immediately after the Is Success column.
# *Column Display:*
#* TransferReason should display the reason for each job transfer, sourced from the backend API response.
#* TransferMode should display the mode of transfer for each job, sourced from the backend API response.
# *Visual Integration:*
#* Ensure the added columns are visually integrated into the existing job transfer history grid layout.
#* Maintain consistency with existing styling and formatting of grid columns.
# *Testing:*
#* Verify through testing that TransferReason and TransferMode columns appear correctly in the job transfer history grid.
#* Validate that the columns are positioned as specified and display accurate data from the backend API.

*Tasks:*

# *UI Layout Modification:*
#* Update the frontend UI components to accommodate TransferReason and TransferMode columns in the job transfer history grid.
# *Column Integration:*
#* Integrate TransferReason and TransferMode data received from the backend API into the grid display.
# *Styling and Formatting:*
#* Apply appropriate styling and formatting to ensure TransferReason and TransferMode columns align with the grid's visual design.
# *Testing and Validation:*
#* Conduct thorough testing to confirm the correct display and functionality of the new columns.
#* Ensure the columns behave responsively across different screen sizes and devices.

*Additional Notes:*

* Coordinate closely with the backend developer to align frontend display requirements with the data structure provided by the API.
* Seek feedback from stakeholders to ensure the job transfer history grid meets usability and informational requirements.",Done,07/Jul/24 11:22 AM,Namrata Maurya,642a85341993b61a5309ad8f,Digvijay Verma,557058:11a4a9a4-23c7-4c3a-8a4d-6c475eaa26a1,Medium,Done,09/Dec/24 2:16 AM,IRIS-JobTracking,,,06/Dec/24 12:00 AM,,Release_0014,,57987,Job Tracking I Display Job Transfer Reason and Transfer Mode in Job Transfer History

*Description:*
The current API endpoint for fetching job transfer logs needs to be extended to include three additional fields: TransferReason, TransferMode, and BatchId. These fields are mapped from the JobTransferLog table, where JobTransferReasonId and JobTransferTypeId are foreign keys to the MasterLookup table, which contains Id, Code, and Description. The BatchId field is a GUID column in the JobTransferLog table, uniquely identifying batches of job transfers. Including these fields will provide users with detailed information about each job transfer, including the reason, mode, and batch identification.

*Acceptance Criteria:*

# *Database Changes:*
#* Ensure the JobTransferLog table has columns JobTransferReasonId, JobTransferTypeId, and BatchId.
#* JobTransferReasonId and JobTransferTypeId are foreign keys to the MasterLookup table for mapping descriptions.
#* BatchId is a GUID column uniquely identifying batches of job transfers.
# *API Changes:*
#* Modify the existing API endpoint to include TransferReason, TransferMode, and BatchId fields in the response from the JobTransferLog endpoint.
#* TransferReason should map JobTransferReasonId to the Description in the MasterLookup table.
#* TransferMode should map JobTransferTypeId to the Description in the MasterLookup table.
#* BatchId should be included as a direct field from the JobTransferLog table.
# *Response Structure:*
#* Update the response structure to include the new fields for each job transfer log entry:

# *Unit and Integration Testing:*
#* Write unit tests to ensure that the API correctly fetches and includes the new fields in the response.
#* Write integration tests to validate the end-to-end functionality of the enhanced API.

*Tasks:*

# *Update Database Schema:*
#* Verify the presence of JobTransferReasonId, JobTransferTypeId, and BatchId columns in the JobTransferLog table and their relationships with the MasterLookup table.
# *Enhance API Endpoint:*
#* Modify the existing API logic to include TransferReason, TransferMode, and BatchId fields in the response.
# *Testing:*
#* Develop and run unit tests to validate the new fields are correctly populated.
#* Perform integration testing to ensure the API works as expected with the new enhancements.
# *Documentation:*
#* Update API documentation to include details about the new fields (TransferReason, TransferMode, and BatchId) in the response.

*Title:*
As a user, I should be able to see the columns of Job Transfer Reason and Transfer Mode in the History of Job Transfer module so that I can see the reason and mode of the transferred job.

*Description:*
Currently, the History of Job Transfer module does not display the reason for a job transfer or the mode of transfer. This information is crucial for users to understand the context and details of each job transfer. By adding these two columns to the module, users will have a more comprehensive view of the job transfer history.

* The user should be able to see a column Job 'Transfer Mode’, which contains the Mode(Regular or Force Transfer) which was added during the job transfer.
* The default position of column should be after the 'Is success' column
* The remaining functionality of the column should be consistent, that is the filter should be available for the Job transfer Reason and transfer mode column
